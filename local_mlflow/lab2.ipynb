    "# Experiment Tracking and Model Registry Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will each download a new dataset and attempt to train a good model, and use mlflow to keep track of all of your experiments, log your metrics, artifacts and models, and then register a final set of models for \"deployment\", though we won't actually deploy them anywhere yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is **not** to become a master at MLFlow - this is not a course on learning all of the ins and outs of MLFlow. Instead, your goal is to understand when and why it is important to track your model development process (tracking experiments, artifacts and models) and to get into the habit of doing so, and then learn at least the basics of how MLFlow helps you do this so that you can then compare with other tools that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have selected a set of data, create a brand new experiment in MLFlow and begin exploring your data. Do some EDA, clean up, and learn about your data. You do not need to begin tracking anything yet, but you can if you want to (e.g. you can log different versions of your data as you clean it up and do any feature engineering). Do not spend a ton of time on this part. Your goal isn't really to build a great model, so don't spend hours on feature engineering and missing data imputation and things like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your data is clean, begin training models and tracking your experiments. If you intend to use this same dataset for your final project, then start thinking about what your model might look like when you actually deploy it. For example, when you engineer new features, be sure to save the code that does this, as you will need this in the future. If your final model has 1000 complex features, you might have a difficult time deploying it later on. If your final model takes 15 minutes to train, or takes a long time to score a new batch of data, you may want to think about training a less complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when tracking your experiments, at a *minimum*, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try at least 3 different ML algorithms (e.g. linear regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.).\n",
    "2. Do hyperparameter tuning for **each** algorithm.\n",
    "3. Do some very basic feature selection, and repeat the above steps with these reduced sets of features.\n",
    "4. Identify the top 3 best models and note these down for later.\n",
    "6. Choose the **final** \"best\" model that you would deploy or use on future data, stage it (in MLFlow), and run it on the test set to get a final measure of performance. Don't forget to log the test set metric.\n",
    "7. Be sure you logged the exact training, validation, and testing datasets for the 3 best models, as well as hyperparameter values, and the values of your metrics.  \n",
    "8. Push your code to Github. No need to track the mlruns folder, the images folder, any datasets, or the sqlite database in git.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turning It In\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MLFlow UI, next to the refresh button you should see three vertical dots. Click the dots and then download your experiments as a csv file. Open the csv file in Excel and highlight the rows for your top 3 models from step 4, highlight the run where you applied your best model to the test set, and then save as an excel file. Take a snapshot of the Models page in the MLFLow UI showing the model you staged in step 6 above. Submit the excel file and the snapshot to Canvas."
